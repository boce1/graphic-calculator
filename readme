This is simple graph calculator made with Python using Pygame graphic library

With left mouse click user can move the camera, with scrool user can zoom

Function that user wants to display can be written in graph_input.txt with Python syntax

Pressing "i" inverts colors

Pressing "o" enables/disables dots

When cursor is on some point when dots are enabled, user can see cordinates of that point

Pressing "r" or "spacebar" read from the input file and reloads functions on the screen

Note: functions must be written with Python syntax




Cheatsheet for functions:

sin(x) -> It returns the sine of the number (in radians)

cos(x) -> It returns the cosine of the number (in radians)

tan(x) -> It returns the tangent of the number (in radians)

acos(x) -> It returns the arc cosine of the number (in radians)

asin(x) -> It returns the arc sine of the number (in radians)

atan(x) -> It returns the arc tangent of the number (in radians)

e**x or exp(x) -> It returns e^x (e being the Euler's constant 2.718281828459045235)

log(x) -> It returns logarithm with base e
